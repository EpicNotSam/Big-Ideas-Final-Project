### Which neighborhood in Pittsburgh has the best roads and drivers?
In our project, we will determine which neighborhood in Pittrburgh has the best roads and drivers by analyzing different datasets. The datasets we looked at for this assignment covered information on average traffic counts taken at random times, vehicles blocking bike lanes, and number of crashes in the different neighborhoods.
