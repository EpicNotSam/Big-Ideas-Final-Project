### Which neighborhood in Pittsburgh has the best roads and drivers?
In our project, we will determine which neighborhood in Pittrburgh has the best roads and drivers by analyzing different datasets. The datasets we looked at for this assignment covered information on average traffic counts taken at random times, vehicles blocking bike lanes, and number of crashes in the different neighborhoods.


### Datasets referenced:

1. [Neighborhoods](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/neighborhoods2) - this dataset allowed us to relate the latitude and longitude from the other datasets to the neighborhood names

2. [Traffic Counts](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-traffic-counts/resource/8edd8a76-8607-4ed3-960f-dcae914fd937?view_id=838354b4-3f5d-46ab-ad01-06c1dc233472) - this dataset was used in Ben's section to analyze the average vehicle count at each sensor taken randomly, in random neighborhoods

3. [Bike Lanes](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/data-protected-bike-lanes-oct-2019/resource/6f53b0c2-4919-4145-adb6-7f1622437b7e) - this dataset was used in Sam's section to analyze the amount of vehicles and the type of bike lane violation they were committing

4. [Crash Data](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-crash-data/resource/e3b145c0-41ba-4cc9-9054-8f686ac59643) - this dataset was used in Brian's section to analyze the amount of crashes recorded for each neighborhood
